# Use Case: Seamless Global Payouts with Interledger

## Introduction
As the global economy becomes increasingly digital, the need for borderless financial transactions has never been greater. From Web3 DAOs to remote-first startups, organizations are tapping into international communities for talent, creativity, and innovation.

But here’s the catch: many contributors around the world don’t have access to traditional banking systems. High remittance fees, delayed payments, and limited access to global platforms remain key barriers.

**Chimoney’s `Payout to Interledger Wallet Address` endpoint solves this problem** by enabling businesses to send payments directly to Interledger-compatible wallets. This ensures fast, inclusive, and low-fee global payouts—all with a simple API call.

## Real-World Scenario: Paying Remote Hackathon Winners

Let’s say you’re hosting a global hackathon with winners in Kenya, Brazil, and the Philippines. Rather than worry about currency conversion or bank delays, you choose to pay all winners via Interledger wallets.

**Without Chimoney:**
- Manual processes
- Expensive third-party remittance tools
- Long wait times
- Limited visibility and compliance headaches

**With Chimoney:**
- Automated payouts via API
- Recipients use Interledger wallets (e.g. `user.rfi.ilp.network`)
- Instant, direct payments
- Built-in tracking, transparency, and tax handling
