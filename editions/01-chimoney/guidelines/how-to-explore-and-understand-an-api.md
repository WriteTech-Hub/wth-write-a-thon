# üîç How to Explore and Understand an API

Before writing technical content about an API‚Äîwhether a use case, tutorial, or setup guide, you need to understand how the API works.

This guide will help you explore a public API endpoint confidently and extract the insights you need to create clear, accurate, and developer-friendly content.

## 1. Understand the goal of the API endpoint

Start by answering these questions:

- What does this API endpoint do?
- Who would use it, and in what real-world situation?
- What problem does it solve?

**Tip:** Look for real-life scenarios in fintech, gig work, e-commerce, or international transfers that match the API‚Äôs purpose.

## 2. Read the official documentation

Go through the official Chimoney API docs for your selected endpoint. Focus on:

- **Authentication**: What type is required? API key? Bearer token?
- **Endpoint Method & URL**: Is it a `GET`, `POST`, or other method?
- **Parameters**: What inputs are needed (path, query, or request body)?
- **Example Requests**: Are there code samples you can try?
- **Example Responses**: What data is returned?

Take notes on anything that is unclear or undocumented. You‚Äôll either clarify it in your writing or note it as a limitation.

## 3. Test the endpoint yourself

Use tools like:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)
- Terminal with `curl`

### When testing:

| Step           | What to Check                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication | Do you need to pass a token or key?                        |
| Parameters     | Are they required or optional? What formats work?          |
| Responses      | What does a success response look like? What about errors? |
| Edge Cases     | What happens if you pass a wrong or missing parameter?     |

**Tip:** Save your test results. You‚Äôll reuse these in your tutorial or setup guide.

## 4. Identify setup requirements

This is especially useful for writing your setup guide later.

Look for:

- API keys or tokens needed
- Base URL and headers
- Required libraries or SDKs
- Account or developer access setup
- Test vs production environment differences

Write down every prerequisite someone else would need before they can start using the endpoint.

## 5. Prepare Your content plan

Once you're familiar with the API:

- Use your testing experience to build a relevant **use case**
- Walk through your steps again to shape your **tutorial**
- List and explain your setup process in a beginner-friendly **setup guide**

## Quick checklist

- [x] I understand what this API endpoint does and who needs it
- [x] I have reviewed its required inputs and outputs
- [x] I‚Äôve successfully tested the endpoint using sample data
- [x] I‚Äôve documented the authentication, setup, and error behavior

If you can check all the above, you're ready to start writing!
